    <h2>Judge Rules in Favor of 'NBA 2K' Creators in Case Brought by Tattoo Artists</h2>
    <h2>The Ethics of Computer-Generated Actors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong></strong>Controversy over dead actors is coming to life based upon new uses of visual effects and computer-generated imagery (CGI).</li>
      <li><strong>-</strong>Film-makers started to use its technological wonders to bring back actors from the grave.</li>
      <li><strong>+</strong>The use of CGI to change the look of actors is nothing new. For instance, many films have used such CGI methods to digitally de-age actors with striking results (like those found in the Marvel films), or to create spectacular creatures without much physical reality (such as “Gollum” in The Lord of the Rings series).</li>
      <li><strong>+</strong>Many argue that this was the best course of action to take in order to complete film production and honor Paul Walker’s work and character.</li>
      <li><strong>+</strong>Some presenting arguments in defense of adding Cushing’s character into the film by claiming that “actors don’t own characters” (Tylt.com) and that the fact that the character looked the same over the course of the fictional timeline enhanced the aesthetic effects of the movies. Others, like Catherine Shoard, were more critical. She condemned the film’s risky choice saying, “though Cushing’s estate approved his use in Rogue One, I’m not convinced that if I had built up a formidable acting career, I’d then want to turn in a performance I had bupkis to do with.”</li>
      <li><strong>-</strong>This use of CGI to bring back dead actors and place them into film raises troubling questions about consent. Assuming that actors should only appear in films that they choose to, how can we be assured that such post-mortem uses are consistent with the actor’s wishes?</li>
      <li><strong>-</strong>Filmic use of CGI actors extends worries over “deepfakes” (AI-created fake videos) and falsified videos into the murkier realm of fictional products and narratives. While we like continuity in actors as a way to preserve our illusion of reality in films, what ethical pitfalls await us as we CGI the undead—or the unwilling—into our films or artworks?</li>
