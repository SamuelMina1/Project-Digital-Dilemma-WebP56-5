    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The Article talks about the use of CGI ( computer-generated imagery ) in Hollywood to bring back deceased actors for scenes that are needed for a movie or show. Some say it's immoral but filmmakers say it's indeed moral as they were given consent to be able to do it. It also talks about how CGI could be used for immoral stuff like deep fakes.</p>
