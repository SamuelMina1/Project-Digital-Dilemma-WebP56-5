     <li>What's been digitized? How is the data represented digitally?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>DNA digitization is the process of transferring genetic data from a biological sample of a person into a digital format for examination and storage.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
   <!--quadrant 2-->
     <li>What is the goal or purpose of digitizing DNA?</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Enabling quick and easy genetic information analysis for each individual is the main objective of digitizing DNA. This is frequently carried out for family history research, health insights, and ancestry testing.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
   <!--quadrant 3-->
  <li>Benefits from digitizing this content?</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Digital DNA data can be advantageous to several parties. Businesses that provide DNA testing services make money on the sale of these tests. Aggregated genetic data might be useful to researchers for scientific breakthroughs. People can also gain knowledge about their health and heritage.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
   <!--quadrant 3-->
  <li>Detriments from digitizing this content?</li>
  <ul>
  <li>The digitalization of DNA carries certain possible hazards. If this data's security is jeopardized, it might result in abuse of genetic information and privacy violations. Furthermore, people may suffer psychological damage if they find out about disturbing or unexpected genetic information.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
   <!--quadrant 4-->
  <li>Is our world better or worse because of digital representation?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The effects of DNA digitization include a combination of unwanted and planned outcomes. Businesses want to turn a profit and offer genetic insights. On the other hand, data abuse and privacy violations are unintentional outcomes. While the possibility of harm is acknowledged, its precise nature and scope may not always be known, thus precautions must be taken to reduce risks.
